# Conditional McKean-Vlasov Control With Deep Learning

This is a code that accompanies the paper titled [Deep learning for conditional McKeanâ€“Vlasov jump diffusions](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4760864) that is a joint work with Prof. Dr. Nacira Agram. Please refer to the abovementioned paper when using code on this repository. 
In particular, we develop an algorithm that learns the optimal control in jump-diffusion models with the inclusion of common noise, where the latter is modelled by regression on signatures of paths. More information about the algorithm can be found in the paper. 

## Code Structure

* **DataGenerator.py**: the artificial data in terms of Brownian and Poissonian increments is generated
* **DeepSolver.py**: Deep learning algorithm for learning the optimal control
* **MathModel.py**: Mathematical models for control problems used in computations
* **Net.py**: Neural network architecture
* **Tests.py**: The main file that should be run to obtain the results. Includes initializations of models as used in the paper.

## Requirements

Due to the requirements of the *signatory* package, this project uses Python 3.7. We refer you to their project [website](https://pypi.org/project/signatory/) for further information, especially regarding the installation.
